## Welcome!

I’m a Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Political Science at Yale University. My research interests include collective action and political violence; local political order in civil wars; African politics, culture and development; and contemporary political theory. 

For my dissertation, I seek to explain different forms of local security arrangement during civil wars, the formation of militias and paramilitaries and their impact on civil war dynamics. In 2011-2012, I conducted fieldwork on the post-independence war in Mozambique. 

Before coming to Yale, I studied political science at Free University Berlin, Germany, and Sciences Po Paris, France, where I concentrated on the study of armed conflict and contemporary political theory. My professional experience include a stay in Malawi where I worked for the German Organization for Technical Cooperation (GTZ, now GIZ) and conducted a study on conflicts between traditional authorities and elected local councilors. I also did research on protracted refugee situations in Zambia for a local Zambian NGO.

I’m a contributor to the blog [Africa is a Country](http://africasacountry.com/ "Africa is a Country").
