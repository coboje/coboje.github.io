## Welcome!

I’m a Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Political Science at Yale University. I study the consequences of armed conflict for political order. My fields of interest are international relations, comparative politics, security studies, African politics, and qualitative methods. 

In my dissertation, I analyze the constitutive dynamics of civil war violence and political order. I seek to explain community mobilization against wartime violence, the formation of militias—armed organizations besides incumbent and insurgent armies—, and their impact on war dynamics. I conducted one year of fieldwork in Mozambique on the country’s post-independence war. The research was supported by the National Science Foundation and the Yale MacMillan Center for International and Area Studies. 

Before coming to Yale, I studied political science at Free University Berlin, Germany, and at Sciences Po Paris, France. My professional experience include a stay in Malawi where I worked for the German Organization for Technical Cooperation (GTZ, now GIZ) and conducted a study on conflicts between traditional authorities and elected local councilors. I also did research on protracted refugee situations in Zambia for a local Zambian NGO.

I’m a contributor to the blog [Africa is a Country](http://africasacountry.com/ "Africa is a Country").
