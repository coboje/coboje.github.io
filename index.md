## Welcome!

I’m an assistant professor of International Relations at the Institute of Political Science at Leiden University. I study civil wars and the emergence of informal institutions of security governance. My current research focuses on community mobilization against insurgent violence, the formation of militias—parties to armed conflict that are neither incumbents nor insurgents—and their impact on civil war dynamics. I’m also broadly interested in African politics, transnational aspects of civil wars, and peacekeeping. I have conducted field research in Mozambique, Zambia, and Malawi. 

Before coming to Leiden, I studied at Free University Berlin, Sciences Po Paris, and Yale University. I’m a contributor to [Africa is a Country](http://africasacountry.com/ "Africa is a Country"), and you can follow me on Twitter (@coboje).
