## Welcome!

I’m a Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Political Science at Yale University. I study the dynamic production of order during armed conflict. My fields of interest are international relations, comparative politics, security studies, African politics, and qualitative research methods. 

In my dissertation, I analyze the relation between civil war violence and order. I seek to explain community mobilization against insurgent violence, the formation of militias—armed organizations besides incumbent and insurgent armies—and their impact on war dynamics. I conducted one year of fieldwork in Mozambique on the country’s post-independence war. The research was supported by the National Science Foundation and the Yale MacMillan Center for International and Area Studies. 

Before coming to Yale, I studied political science at Free University Berlin, Germany, and at Sciences Po Paris, France. My professional experience include a stay in Malawi where I worked for the German Organization for Technical Cooperation (GTZ, now GIZ) and conducted a study on traditional authorities in democracies. I also did research on protracted refugee situations in Zambia for a local Zambian NGO.

I’m a contributor to the blog [Africa is a Country](http://africasacountry.com/ "Africa is a Country").
