## Teaching

In teaching international relations and comparative politics, my goal is to nurture my students’ ability to critically engage with political events, become knowledgeable observers of political processes, and active participants in these processes as informed citizens.

Please contact me for my complete teaching portfolio that includes my statement of teaching philosophy, sample syllabi and student and peer evaluations.
